# Multithreading-Experiments
## Parallel and Distributed Programming Project 2
This repository holds some of our experiments in multithreading existing algorithms, and the issues that arise in terms of parallelizing, synchronizing, and verifying their correctness. Several sorting algorithm, minimum spanning tree graph algorithm, and password cracking algorithms are explored.

### Installing
